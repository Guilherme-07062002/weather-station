# Weather Station with ESP32

**Subject**: Programming for IoT

## Challenge 2

The second challenge consists of developing a station
weather using Wokwi.

### Specifications

- The meterological station must provide information on humidity,temperature and luminosity. Tip: use `DHT22` and `LDR`;
- The data must be presented on a screen;
- The LDR should be used to indicate whether it is morning or night, based on luminosity;
- On the display it is possible to use images such as a sun or a moon to indication of day and night.
  - There is material on the internet about how do that. Images are not mandatory, just a suggestion for the screens;
- A button must be used to change the day indication display and night, for temperature indication and humidity indication;
- The idea is to work like a SmartWatch, with a single button controls all information;
